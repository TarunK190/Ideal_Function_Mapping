# Python Ideal Function Mapping Project

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how training data, test data, and ideal functions can be connected to produce meaningful results.  
It uses **object-oriented design (OOD)** principles, a **database** for structured storage, **visualization** for clarity, and **unit testing** to ensure correctness.  

The main goal is to identify the best-fitting ideal functions for the training data using the **Sum of Squared Deviations (SSD)**, and then map test data points to those functions within a defined deviation range.
